## Claude-backed squad command. A policy is just a prompt: the game server
## composes the seat's fogged view plus that seat's PLAYER_PROMPT and asks
## Claude what its cogs do for the next 4.5 seconds.
##
## Ported from `cogame-bullwhip/src/bullwhip/llm.nim`, behaviour for
## behaviour — the credential ladder, the Bedrock model rotation, the
## fence-tolerant JSON extraction and the rune-boundary truncation are all
## that file's, because they are all scar tissue from real hosted failures.
##
## Paintball is a SIMULTANEOUS-decision game, so both seats' calls go out as
## ONE parallel batch per turn (`curly.makeRequests`). Seats are never queried
## sequentially: that is what keeps 40 turns inside the wall-clock budget.
##
## Credentials, in order of preference:
##   Bedrock sidecar (AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME + AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK)
##   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
##   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_URI
## With none of them the client disables itself and every turn falls back to
## the scripted layer INSTANTLY, with no network wait — which is what lets
## offline certification finish in seconds.

You command a squad of paintball robots in a top-down arena, 1235 by 659 pixels.
Every 4.5 seconds you issue ONE directive for the cogs you command. A deterministic
controller executes it for the next 4.5 seconds: it walks each cog toward its target
around walls, turns it to face what you told it to face, and fires the paint sprayer
when the shot is worth taking. You never control motors or the trigger directly.
The game is KING OF THE HILL. One hill sits at the centre of the map. Your team OWNS
it while at least 80% of the hill's floor tiles are your colour, and you bank points
every tick you own it. The team with more banked hill time wins.
Paint is also a buff: standing on YOUR colour makes a cog 25% faster and heals one hit
point every 2 seconds; standing on THEIR colour makes it 15% slower. Painting the lane
you attack down is not decoration, it is your speed.
A sprayed cog loses 1 of its 3 hit points; three touches tag it out for 2 seconds.
You cannot see the whole map: enemies appear only inside your cogs' vision cones and
their small bubbles, and the report tells you how many ticks ago each one was seen.
Reply with a single JSON object and NOTHING else. Your reply MUST begin with '{'.
Schema:
{"note":"<=160 chars","cogs":[
  {"id":"<one of the cogs you command>",
   "intent":"paint_hill|hold_hill|hunt|guard|paint_path|fall_back",
   "target":[x,y],
   "face":[x,y] or null,
   "say":"<=10 chars"} , ... one entry per cog you command ]}
Intents: paint_hill = go to the nearest hill tile that is not yours and paint it;
hold_hill = stay on the hill, keep it yours, spray anyone who steps on it;
hunt = close on the nearest enemy you know about and spray it;
guard = hold `target` and watch the hill; paint_path = paint a lane from where you are
toward `target`; fall_back = walk to `target` without spraying. `face` biases the aim
when nothing is in range. `say` is SHOUTED and the enemy hears it if they are close.
