## The directive schema: what a commander (LLM or scripted) may say, how a
## reply is parsed TOLERANTLY, and how an illegal reply is repaired instead of
## rejected.
##
## Both policy kinds emit the SAME object, so the two are strictly comparable
## and one validator covers both — that is what makes the bounded-orders test
## in tests/test_control.nim meaningful.
##
## RUNE DISCIPLINE. Every cap in this file is measured in RUNES (Unicode
## codepoints) and every truncation lands on a rune boundary (`runeLen` /
## `runeSubStr`). Slicing a string by BYTE index anywhere on the path to the
## replay is forbidden: a byte-truncated multi-byte character renders fine in a
## browser and then fails a strict UTF-8 parser, which is exactly the class of
## bug that makes a replay unreadable to everything except the one viewer that
## happened to be lenient.
