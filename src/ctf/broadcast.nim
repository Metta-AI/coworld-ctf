## Replay broadcast state channel.
##
## Derives the designed broadcast client's JSON chrome state from the live
## sim. The binary sprite stream stays the board renderer; this module produces
## the parallel TextMessage the broadcast client reads to draw the scorebug,
## kill feed, banners, roster, transport and end-card.
##
## Beat-event derivation mirrors `tools/expand_replay.nim` exactly (per-victim
## death/alive diffs, carrier diffs, capture diffs, phase transitions), so the
## broadcast tells the same story the timeline tool would. Events are derived
## ONE SIM STEP AT A TIME (`stepEvents`) and accumulated by the caller across a
## playback frame, so kill attribution stays exact even at 16x — never
## collapsing a whole span into one ambiguous marker. Attribution still
## degrades honestly to "ambiguous" only on a genuine same-tick multi-kill
## (fidelity rule F7). Kills are never rendered as score (F1); flags have
## exactly HOME/TAKEN/CAPTURED states (F2 — CAPTURED added in GV32, when a
## captured heart retires instead of ending the game); the end-card names
## the tiebreak key and checks a draw before a winner (F3/F4).
