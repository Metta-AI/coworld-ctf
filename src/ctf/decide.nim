## The decision layer: the per-turn loop that asks both commanders what their
## squads do next, and always has an answer.
##
## Cadence: one turn every `turnTicks` (108 ticks = 4.5 s of sim time), 20
## turns per game, 40 per episode. At each turn the server builds BOTH seats'
## request bodies and issues them as ONE parallel batch — paintball is a
## simultaneous-decision game, so querying seats one after another would
## double the wall clock for no gain. One call per seat per turn covers all of
## that seat's commanded cogs.
##
## DEGRADE, NEVER HANG. Every wait here is bounded: attempt 1 gets
## `attempt1Ms`, the single retry gets `retryMs`, and the whole turn is
## wrapped in a monotonic `turnBudgetMs` deadline. A provider throttle with no
## other candidate model skips the retry outright (it cannot land) and fails
## fast to the scripted layer for that turn. On a second failure the seat
## plays the `holdline` scripted directive for that turn and a `fallback`
## record names the cause. No failure mode leaves a cog unactuated: the
## control layer always has a directive — this turn's, else last turn's, else
## `holdline`'s.
