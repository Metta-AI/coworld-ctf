# The one-page-policy REFLASH record.
#
# Season 2 flashes a cog a JSON strategy page: once at episode start, and
# again at an arbitrary tick (BR re-strategizes mid-episode; its cogs have
# ONE life, so there is no spawn edge to hang it on) or on each respawn
# (CTF). That page swap is an out-of-band INPUT to the episode. Nothing in
# the recorded button masks witnesses it, so a replay that does not carry it
# re-simulates a match under a strategy it never played — silently. This
# record is what makes it carriable, and gameHash (sim_state.nim) is what
# makes losing it LOUD.
#
# WHY IT RIDES THE CHAT RECORD, and why the format version does NOT move.
# The codec's version check is strict equality (`bitworld/replays.nim`:
# "Unsupported replay format version"), so bumping CtfReplayFormatVersion
# would not "add a record type" — it would reject every replay ever
# archived, on the spot. The codec also raises on any record type it does
# not know, so a brand-new record byte is unreadable by anything not rebuilt
# in lockstep. Both roads end at "old replays stop loading", which is the
# one thing this change is not allowed to do.
#
# So the reflash rides an EXISTING record, exactly the way direct aim rides
# the input record (ReplayAimRecordFlag above, and for the same reasons):
# the chat record is already {time, player, string} — tick, seat, content —
# already parsed by every existing reader, and already the stream whose
# payload reaches the sim. Only the `player` byte's high bit is spent, which
# a cog index can never set (MaxPlayers is 32). Old replays contain no such
# record and load byte-for-byte as before; a new replay identifies itself
# through its header config (`allowPolicyReflash`, sim_config.nim), not
# through a version number.
