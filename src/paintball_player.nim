## The paintball player container: a policy is just a prompt.
##
## This process is DELIBERATELY thin. It connects to its seat, sends ONE
## Sprite v1 chat message carrying its registration, and then only receives.
## Every decision happens inside the GAME server, because that is the only
## container the platform injects the `anthropic_api_key` coworld secret
## into, and because keeping the control layer server-side is what makes the
## recorded mask log reproducible with no network in the loop.
##
##   PLAYER_PROMPT        a strategy in plain English -> this seat is an LLM seat
##   PLAYER_SCRIPTED      holdline | sprayer         -> this seat is scripted
##   PLAYER_POLICY_LABEL  a free label for the replay's `register` record
##
## A seat that sets neither is `holdline`. To field your own policy, reuse
## this image and set PLAYER_PROMPT:
##
##   coworld upload-policy <paintball-image> --name my-paintball \
##     --run /bin/paintball-player --secret-env PLAYER_PROMPT="<your strategy>"

  # received frame can both land while the seat has no index yet. The server
  # dropped them and the champion played the scripted baseline for the whole
  # episode (paintball round 3, 2026-08-25). The server now holds an
  # unappliable registration, and this end keeps re-sending it for the first
  # ~10 s of frames, which covers the lobby whichever seat connects first.
