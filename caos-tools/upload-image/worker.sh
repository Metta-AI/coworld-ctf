# Push the policy image to softmax and register it as a policy version. See
# .caos-expr for the agent-facing docs; this header is the mechanism.
#
# THREE STAGES, one script, selected by a curried --stage:
#
#   narrow  (default) curry build-image, run-then it
#   realize the `then`: ask the SERVER to convert build-image's git-docker
#           DELTA, and take back the ref it converted to
#   push    the platform conversation: request, push, complete, register
#
# WHY THE SERVER CONVERTS AND WE JUST ASK. `caos resolve-image` (Metta-AI/caos
# #148, added for this) returns the ref the server already computed and cached
# for a git-docker tree. This stage used to do the convert itself — pull the
# base with skopeo, tar layer00, append its diff_id to the config and its
# descriptor to the manifest — which was `convert_git_image` reimplemented in
# bash, against the same base, with the same arithmetic in a second place. It
# had already produced one real bug that way (an OCI layer on a docker v2s2
# base). The 68 MB base still never enters the CAS: the server names it, and
# nothing here fetches it.
#
# WHY NOT THE OFFICIAL PYTHON CLI. coworld ships `upload-policy`, and these
# three calls are written against its `upload.py` rather than delegating to it.
# This is a COST TRADE, not an impossibility — be clear about that, because two
# tempting reasons to dismiss the CLI are both wrong:
#
#   - "it's a container" — it is not. It is an ordinary pip package, and this
#     repo already runs it host-side via `uvx` to upload the coworld itself
#     (.github/workflows/upload-coworld-paintbot.yml).
#   - "a worker has no docker" — podman runs rootless inside a container and
#     emulates the docker CLI, so a worker CAN serve the `docker image
#     inspect`/`pull`/`save` calls the CLI shells out to, with no
#     CAOS_GRANT_ENGINE_SOCKET and no root-equivalent grant.
#
# The actual reason is that the CLI wants the image IN A LOCAL ENGINE STORE,
# and this pipeline is built so it never lands in one. build-image emits a
# git-docker delta, the caos server converts it, and skopeo moves it
# registry-to-registry. Nothing ever materialises the image locally — that is
# why the 68 MB base does not enter the CAS and a policy rebuild moves only its
# own layer.
#
# To use the CLI we would add podman, python, uv and coworld's dependency tree
# to a worker image that is currently skopeo, jq and curl; then pull ~69 MB
# into a local store and `docker image save` it back out to a tarball — so that
# a client can make three HTTP calls that curl makes here in 30 lines. The
# price is paid in image size and moving parts, every run, to avoid writing
# three requests.
#
# What it costs us instead: the API surface is not ours, and we track it by
# reading upload.py. That bill has been paid once — the base URL was wrong
# twice (api.softmax.com does not exist; every route hangs off /observatory)
# and only a live run found it.
#
# RECONSIDER IF:
#   - we need more of the platform than these three calls (leagues, campaigns,
#     experience requests). Re-implementing that surface in bash would be a bad
#     trade where three calls was a good one.
#   - the endpoints drift more than about once. Two base-URL bugs were
#     affordable; a pattern means the CLI's version pinning is worth more than
#     a lean worker.
#   - a worker needs podman anyway for some other reason. Most of the cost
#     above is that dependency; if something else already pays it, the argument
#     for hand-rolling gets much weaker.
# Simplest alternative if any of those bite: move the upload host-side and call
# the CLI, as the coworld upload already does. That is a small script, not a
# rewrite — what it gives up is image-keyed caching and the secrets injection.
#
# THE TOKEN IS A SECRET, NOT AN ARGUMENT. caos injects it at /secret/<name>;
# only the secret's NAME and entropy reach this job's cache key, never its
# value, so rotating a token does not invalidate anything (caos SPEC,
# "Secrets"). An --token argument would have put it in the CAS.
