# Assemble the submittable policy image. See .caos-expr for the agent-facing
# docs; this header is the mechanism.
#
# TWO STAGES, one script, selected by a curried --stage:
#
#   narrow  (default) narrow the tree, curry `build-player`, run-then it
#   assemble the `then`: --result is build-player's {bin,report,status}
#
# WHY THIS COMPILES NOTHING. players/baseline/Dockerfile's build stage and
# caos/nim are the same image on the same nixpkgs pin, so `build-player`'s
# binary is linked exactly like the shipped one — same glibc RUNPATH, same
# absolute dlopen path for libcurl. That is the whole point of the pin
# coupling: the image is one ~1 MB layer on the published runtime base, not a
# second compile of the same source.
#
# WHY A GIT-DOCKER DELTA AND NOT A TARBALL. caos converts {base, config.json,
# layerNN/…} into an image digest server-side (design/flake-images.md; it is
# how std/flake-builder stacks the caos additions onto a flake image). So the
# 68 MB runtime base is NAMED, never copied: it does not enter the CAS, no job
# fetches it, and a policy rebuild moves only its own layer. A docker-archive
# would have put the whole image in the CAS to say one megabyte had changed.
