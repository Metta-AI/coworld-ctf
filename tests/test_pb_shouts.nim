## Every drawn string fits its frame — the shout-bubble half, asserted on the
## real geometry rather than by eye.
##
## A canvas accepts a draw at a negative coordinate without complaint, so a
## bubble anchored where there is no room is invisible to the load signal, to
## the soak and to a screenshot (cogchemists, 2026-08-24: four speech bubbles
## drawn upward from cogs standing at the top of the arena, four sentences
## rendered as four white slivers, everything green).
##
## Paintball's bubbles are rasterised into sprites in Nim and blitted into a
## map-sized layer canvas, so `viewer_smoke.mjs`'s `fillText` hook cannot see
## them (canvas_text total is structurally 0). This file is the gate that can:
## it asks the DRAW PASS's own geometry where every worst-case bubble lands and
## asserts the rect is inside the board. The browser half — the real renderer,
## a frame built to hurt, several canvas sizes — is
## `replay-viewer/text_fixture.html`, driven by `viewer_smoke.mjs
## --strict-text-bounds` in its own ci.yml step.
