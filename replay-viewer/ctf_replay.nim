## --- Progress stage note ---
## wasm32 has no memory protection: when emscripten's malloc fails, a write
## through the nil pointer lands at address 0 and silently corrupts the
## module's own globals instead of trapping (that is how oversized replays
## used to die with ctf_error_len() == 0 and no diagnostic at all). The
## bundle is therefore linked with -s ABORTING_MALLOC=1 — allocation failure
## aborts the runtime loudly — and this fixed buffer, stamped BEFORE each
## risky phase, stays readable from JS after the abort (aborting kills the
## call stack, not the linear memory), so the page can still report what the
## runtime was doing when the 2 GB address space ran out.
