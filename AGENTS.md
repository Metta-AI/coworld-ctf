# Agent operating guide — coworld-ctf

Orientation for coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) working in this
repo. Gameplay rules live in [docs/RULES.md](docs/RULES.md); this file
covers the workflows that are easy to get wrong.

## Layout

- `src/ctf.nim` — server entrypoint (seed randomization happens HERE,
  before `config.update`, so seed-derived draws — including the terrain
  pick — follow the final seed).
- `src/ctf/` sim modules (split per `docs/plans/2026-08-01-sim-split.md`;
  `sim.nim` imports and RE-EXPORTS all of them, so `import ctf/sim` still
  sees everything): `sim_types.nim` — consts (incl. `GameVersion`, which
  gates replay compatibility), types (flatty wire format — field order is
  sacred), map globals; `rig_art.nim` — broadcast-only art;
  `arena.nim` — map geometry, the terrain generator/validators, mapSpec,
  the process-global map install, pixel queries; `map_art.nim` — the map
  bake; `sim_config.nim` — GameConfig lifecycle; `sim_state.nim` — logging,
  gameHash, events, spawn placement; `roster.nim` — join/auth/rewards;
  `sim.nim` — the gameplay core and step loop.
- `src/ctf/map_pool.nim` — GENERATED curated terrain-pool seeds; rewrite it
  only via `tools/gen_map_pool.nim`, never by hand.
- `tests/` — run `nim c -r tests/tests.nim` from the repo ROOT (assets
  resolve via `data/`). Use `-d:release` for anything heavy; debug builds
  are 10-50x slower through the per-pixel map code.
- Dependencies come from nimby (`nimby --global sync nimby.lock`; the
  Dockerfile is the canonical build recipe).

## Terrain

- The **default league map is the hand-tuned arena** (`config.json`
  `mapPath: "arena"`). Do not flip it without an explicit ask.
- **Procedural terrain is config-gated**: `mapPath: "pool"` draws from the
  curated pool (`mapPoolIndex` pins an entry; otherwise the pick derives
  from the randomized game seed), `mapPath: "gen"` + `mapSeed` generates
  directly. Individual draws lock via `mapSize`, `mapSymmetry`
  (`mirror`/`rot180`), `mapColumns`, `mapWindows`, `mapCenterFeature`,
  `mapEndzone` (+ `mapEndzoneRadius` / `mapBaseDepth`).
  Tools accept `gen:<seed>` / `pool:<idx>` map paths.
- **Endzone archetypes** are drawn per seed from a SEPARATE RNG stream
  (`seed xor const`) so the main draw order never shifts: a seed that lands
  on the classic `column` generates byte-for-byte the map it always did,
  and only `disc` / `square` seeds are new terrain. Keep that property when
  adding draws — it is what makes an archetype addition reviewable.
- Replays pin the resolved geometry as `mapSpec` in their config JSON —
  playback never re-runs the generator, so generator changes cannot break
  existing replays.
- Generator design intent lives in the VALIDATORS
  (`validateGeneratedMap`): sightlines, corridor connectivity, cover
  budget. Change behavior there, not by hand-tuning draws.

## Pool review page

[docs/pool-review.html](docs/pool-review.html) is a self-contained,
zoomable review page showing every curated pool map (open it locally or
from any static host; images are inlined). **Regenerate it whenever
`map_pool.nim` or the generator changes**:

```bash
nim c -r tools/gen_map_pool.nim              # only when re-curating seeds
nim c -r tools/render_map_pool.nim pool-preview
python3 tools/build_pool_review.py pool-preview
```

Commit the refreshed `docs/pool-review.html` together with the pool/
generator change — a stale page misrepresents what the pool serves.

## Replay fixtures

`tests/fixtures/*.bitreplay` + `tests/replays/ctf.bitreplay` are recorded
against the CURRENT rules and must be re-recorded on every GameVersion
bump (`tools/record_fixture.sh`; exact recipes in
`tests/test_broadcast_state.nim`). Gotchas:

- Record on an **idle machine** — a CPU-starved speed-16 server drops its
  bots and produces degenerate endings (e.g. no capture).
- The script prefixes `$PWD`: pass **repo-relative** output paths.
- After re-recording, re-pin the capture fixture's asserted winner/ending
  and verify the required beats (capture/steal/gameover) actually occur —
  scan a few seeds if needed.

## Debugging prod league replays (don't drive the Observatory UI)

To investigate a prod replay issue, download the replay bytes directly —
never try to navigate softmax.com/observatory in a browser (sign-in wall,
and the UI adds nothing). The Observatory URL carries everything needed:
`?tab=coworlds&logscope=league:league_<uuid>&detail=league:league_<uuid>` —
the `detail` param is the league being viewed (strip the `league_` prefix
for SQL; `leagues.id` is the bare uuid).

1. Query the prod DB via the read-only `/sql` endpoint (token from
   `~/.softmax/credentials.yaml`, key `https://softmax.com/api`; add headers
   `Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN` and `X-Use-Elevated-Privileges: true`,
   POST to `https://softmax.com/api/observatory/sql/query`):

   ```sql
   -- league -> divisions -> rounds -> episode requests -> job ids
   SELECT era.job_request_id, er.created_at,
          er.game_config->>'teams' AS teams
   FROM episode_requests er
   JOIN episode_request_attempts era ON era.episode_request_id = er.id
   JOIN rounds r ON r.id = er.round_id
   JOIN divisions d ON d.id = r.division_id
   WHERE d.league_id = '<league uuid without prefix>'
   ORDER BY er.created_at DESC;
   ```

2. Every job's replay is public:
   `https://softmax-public.s3.amazonaws.com/replays/<job_request_id>.replay`
   (equivalently `episodes.replay_url`, joined via `episode_jobs`).

3. The file is `COWLDCTF` deterministic format: a JSON config (brace-match
   from the first `{`; includes `mapSpec` dims/layout, teams, player names)
   plus recorded inputs — `parseReplayBytes` + `initReplayRuntime` replays
   it locally, exactly like the wasm viewer.

4. To reproduce the hosted viewer itself:
   `POST https://softmax.com/api/observatory/v2/coworlds/replays/session`
   with `{"coworld_id": "<episode_requests.coworld_id>", "replay_uri": "<s3 url>"}`
   returns the exact static-bundle `viewer_url` prod serves (its
   `broadcast_core.js` / wasm files are directly downloadable, and the
   wasm bundle runs headless under Node — see `tools/wasm_replay_smoke.cjs`).
