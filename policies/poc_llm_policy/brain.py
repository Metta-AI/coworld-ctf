"""The LLM half of the PoC: turn a short match summary into a chat line and a
ladder call.

Backends, all returning the same dict shape::

    {"chat": "<one lobby line>",
     "call": {"entries": [{"play": ..., "entry_id": ..., "params": {...}}, ...]}}

Selected in this order:

1. **The hosted sidecar (production).** A deployed policy pod gets no model
   credentials of its own. The platform runs a per-pod proxy on loopback that
   holds the real identity, and it speaks **OpenAI-compatible chat
   completions**, served by OpenRouter. Selected when
   ``COWORLD_LLM_ENDPOINT`` is present.
2. **Direct OpenRouter (dev/local).** Selected when ``OPENROUTER_API_KEY`` is
   set and no sidecar endpoint is present.
3. **Canned.** A fixed response, so the image is testable offline and in CI.
   Forced by ``--canned``.

The happy consequence of (1) and (2) speaking the same protocol: they are the
*same client class* with a different URL and a different auth header.

Live backends are wrapped in :class:`ResilientBrain`: the first completions
failure of any kind (the sidecar's model-allowlist 403 first among them) is
logged once and the policy degrades to canned decisions instead of dying. A
policy that cannot reach its LLM plays dumb; it never exits 1 over it.

Everything uses ``urllib`` from the standard library, so the image needs no HTTP
or cloud SDK dependency.

The model is never trusted: :mod:`poc_policy` re-validates and repairs whatever
comes back before any of it reaches the wire, and the server's call validator is
the final oracle.

   dissolve at an agreed endgame. Params:

    Notes on the hosted path specifically:

    * ``X-Coworld-Player-Slot`` is deliberately NOT sent. On a player pod the

      disagrees with it is rejected outright
      (``_resolve_request_attribution``, bedrock_sidecar.py:1387-1404). Sending
