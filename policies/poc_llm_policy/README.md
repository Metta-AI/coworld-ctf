# `poc_llm_policy` — a proof-of-concept LLM policy image

A self-contained container that plays one Season 2 play seat end to end: it
carries a **playbook** of wasm play modules, connects to the game server over
the real play-seat WebSocket protocol, uploads the playbook over the wire, asks
an LLM for a lobby line and a ladder call, and sends both — then asks again
mid-match and re-calls.

The LLM is reached the way a deployed policy actually reaches one: through the
platform's per-pod **LLM sidecar** — OpenAI-compatible chat completions, served
by OpenRouter — with no model credentials in the image. A direct OpenRouter
path and a canned path stand behind it for local development and CI, and the
first two are the same client with a different URL and auth header.

This is explicitly a **proof of concept**, not a competitor. It plays badly. Its
value is that it proves an outsider-shaped client, written against the byte
layouts alone, can drive the protocol.

---

## What it proves

| Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| A wasm playbook baked into the image | `build_playbook.sh` compiles `edge_ride` and `pact` from `play_sdk/reference/` with wasi-sdk 33 during the Docker build |
| Connect as a play seat over the real protocol | `ws://host:port/player?slot=N&token=T`, upgraded by the server's play-seat transport |
| Upload the playbook over the wire | 0xA0 ModuleUpload → `module_accepted` → `module_ready` with the server's own sha256 |
| An LLM chooses the chat line and the play call | one model call per decision, two decisions per run, over whichever backend the environment selects |
| It works on the hosted platform's LLM path | the sidecar's OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` is the primary backend, gated on `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME` |
| A mid-match re-call driven by a later model call | a second 0xA1 at a higher proposal id, accepted at epoch 2, with the standing ladder fed back to the model so the re-call is a revision |
| The production validator is the oracle | a deliberately bad call comes back `call_rejected` with `reason` and the offending JSON path |

## What it punts on

- **It does not play well.** The model sees a short text summary, not the game.
  There is no evaluation loop, no reaction to the 0xB1 view stream, and no
  attempt to win.
- **The sidecar path is unproven against a real pod.** It is written to the
  contract read out of the sidecar's own source and exercised against a stub
  built to that contract, which cannot catch a code-versus-behaviour mismatch.
  Nothing here has run in a hosted tournament.
- **One seat.** A real policy image would drive all 32.
- **No reconnect handling in this PoC.** The protocol supports replacement,
  but this client does not exercise it. A production client resumes from the
  replacement `control_context`: accepted call, ready playbook, budgets,
  floors, generation, acknowledgement, and transcript marks. It does not
  re-upload or regain module admission after `Playing` has begun.
- ~~**The status-ack mark is used as a tick pump.**~~ Fixed: the harness now
  acks the highest status ordinal it has actually received, and only when it
  advances. The production server settled this — it refuses a mark beyond what
  it has delivered (`call_rejected` with reason `status_ack_out_of_range`, from
  `handleProductionStatusAck` in `src/ctf/server.nim`) and simply redelivers an
  unacked backlog, so the old blind-increment trick that the PoC glue server
  tolerated is a protocol violation against the real thing.
- **`poc_shell_server.nim` is scaffolding, not product** — see the next section.

---

## The blocker this PoC uncovered

**The production server cannot answer a wire policy today.** `src/ctf/server.nim`
owns the entire receive half — the `/player` upgrade with the play-seat
transport limits, the leading-byte dispatch (`classifyPlaySeatMessage`,
`src/shell/dispatch.nim`), the bounded per-seat ingress queue with its id
floors and budgets (`src/shell/ingress.nim`), and the tick-boundary drain. All
of that works. What is missing is the two ends it hands off to:

1. **No consumer is ever registered.** `registerPlayModuleUploadConsumer`,
   `registerPlayCallConsumer`, `registerPlayStatusAckConsumer`, and
   `registerPlayLobbyChatConsumer` are defined at `src/ctf/server.nim:180-194`
   and called from nowhere in the tree. Every admitted 0xA0/0xA1/0xA2/0xA3 is
   therefore counted into `playProtocolRejected` and dropped.
2. **Nothing sends server→client.** `trySendPlaySocket`
   (`src/shell/transport.nim:26`) has no caller outside its own tests, so
   0xB0 PlayContext, 0xB1 PlayView, and 0xB2 LobbyChatBroadcast are never
   emitted by a running server.

The first-light demo (`tools/run_first_light.sh`) does not hit this, because it
never goes over the wire: `src/shell/episode.nim`'s
`configureFirstLightPlay` reads a `.wasm` off local disk and calls
`compilePlane.admitModule` / `ladder.acceptCall` **in process**, from a config
file. That is a real exercise of the compile and call path, but it is not the
protocol.

`poc_shell_server.nim` supplies exactly the missing glue and nothing else: it
registers the four consumers, encodes the replies with the **production**
`packets.nim` codec, and then hands off to the stock `runServerLoop`. It is a
PoC stand-in for a lane that has not landed, deliberately kept inside this
directory. Its own limits are listed in its file header.

### Update, after `78e05b06` ("a live admission seam on the episode")

Main has since added the seam this PoC should eventually sit on:
`admitPlayModule` and `acceptPlayCall` (`src/shell/episode.nim:468,491`) plus
`FirstLightTickResult.moduleStatuses` (`:85`) give a consumer the episode's
*own* compile plane and ladder, non-blocking, with accepted calls actually
stepped into seat bodies. That commit's message calls out standing up parallel
plane and ladder instances as the shortcut lane B declined to copy — and
standing up parallel instances is exactly what this PoC does.

Two things are still true, so the PoC's shape has not changed yet:

* **The consumers remain unregistered in production.** After the merge the only
  callers of `registerPlay*Consumer` in the tree are in
  `tests/test_shell_dispatch.nim:72-75`. `trySendPlaySocket` still has no
  production caller.
* **The new seam is not reachable from where a consumer runs.** The live
  episode is a local `var` inside `runServerLoop` (`src/ctf/server.nim:3068`)
  with no exported accessor, and a registered consumer is a module-level
  `gcsafe` proc. Lane B can wire this because it is working *inside*
  `server.nim`, where the episode is in scope; an out-of-tree PoC cannot reach
  it at all.

So the PoC keeps its parallel plane and ladder, and its calls still do not
drive seat bodies — but that is now a consequence of a missing accessor, not of
a missing seam. **Migrating `poc_shell_server.nim` onto `admitPlayModule` /
`acceptPlayCall` is the right follow-up the moment `server.nim` exposes the
live episode** (or the moment lane B's own registration lands, at which point
this file should simply be deleted).

### Update, after the production wiring merge (2026-08-31)

Lane B's registration has landed: the production server registers all four
consumers over the live episode seam and sends 0xB0/0xB1/0xB2 itself. The
blocker above is **closed**, verified end to end against the stock
`src/ctf.nim` binary (no glue server) with a live OpenRouter model: playbook
uploaded over the wire (`module_ready` with the server's own hashes), opening
call and a model-revised mid-match re-call both `call_accepted`, chat lines
broadcast on 0xB2, and — the part the glue server never did — the seat body
actually executing the called play (the server's install telemetry flips seat
0 from `provenance=default` to `provenance=entry:ride`, carrying pact's
combat policy for the exact partner seat the model named). Two rig notes for
anyone repeating that run: the lobby-chat window must be open
(`lobbyChatTicks > 0`) or 0xA3 is refused with `lobby_chat:lcrClosed`, and
unfilled slots need presence connections (see `tools/run_first_light.sh`) or
the match never starts / ends instantly. Deleting `poc_shell_server.nim` and
pointing `run_poc.sh` at the stock server is now the standing follow-up.

## Layout

```
poc_llm_policy/
  wire.py              packet codec + canonical JSON, from the byte layouts alone
  brain.py             the model backends: hosted sidecar, OpenRouter, canned
  poc_policy.py        the harness: connect, upload, chat, call, re-call
  build_playbook.sh    compiles edge_ride.wasm and pact.wasm from play_sdk
  poc_shell_server.nim the provisional play-seat server used by this local rig
  run_poc.sh           the end-to-end local proof (server + harness)
  Dockerfile           the image, playbook baked in
```

---

## Run it

### End to end, locally

```bash
policies/poc_llm_policy/run_poc.sh          # canned model response
policies/poc_llm_policy/run_poc.sh --live   # one real OpenRouter call per decision
```

This fetches the wasm/wasi toolchain, builds the playbook, builds the local
play-seat
server, starts it on `POC_PORT` (default 21815) with a config derived from
`config.practice.json` (`season2Shell: true` explicitly restates the engine
default; every slot is switched to
`control: "play"`), and runs the harness against slot 0. It prints the harness
log and then the server's own `POC_WIRE_*` lines.

The harness needs `websockets`; `run_poc.sh` prefers
`policies/poc_llm_policy/.venv/bin/python` if you have made one:

```bash
python3 -m venv policies/poc_llm_policy/.venv
policies/poc_llm_policy/.venv/bin/pip install "websockets>=13"
```

### The image

Build from the **repository root** — the playbook is compiled from `play_sdk/`
during the build:

```bash
docker build -f policies/poc_llm_policy/Dockerfile -t poc-llm-policy .

# Offline / CI: no model credentials of any kind.
docker run --rm \
  -e POC_HOST=host.docker.internal -e POC_PORT=21815 \
  -e POC_SLOT=0 -e POC_TOKEN=0xBADA55_0 \
  poc-llm-policy --canned

# Local dev against a real model, with your own key.
docker run --rm \
  -e POC_HOST=host.docker.internal -e POC_PORT=21815 \
  -e POC_SLOT=0 -e POC_TOKEN=0xBADA55_0 \
  -e OPENROUTER_API_KEY="$OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
  poc-llm-policy
```

**In a hosted tournament you pass no key at all.** The platform injects the
sidecar environment into the pod, the harness detects
`AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME` and takes the Bedrock path automatically, and
the image itself carries no credentials. That is the whole point of the backend
order — see "The model backends" below. Upload with
`--use-bedrock --bedrock-model <id>`.

The server has to be reachable from inside the container: start it with
`COGAME_HOST=0.0.0.0` and use `host.docker.internal` (Docker Desktop) or
`--network host` with `POC_HOST=127.0.0.1` (Linux). `run_poc.sh` binds the
server to loopback, so for a container run start the server yourself.

### Environment

| Variable | Set by | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME` | the platform, in a hosted pod | **presence selects the production backend.** Never hardcode it |
| `BEDROCK_MODEL` | `--bedrock-model` at upload | the model id the sidecar backend calls; always preferred when set. A legacy Bedrock id or a canonical `vendor/model` slug both work — the sidecar resolves aliases. When absent, the harness falls back to the default model |
| `POC_LLM_PROTOCOL` | you, rarely | `bedrock` switches the sidecar call to the legacy `InvokeModel` shape. Opt-in escape hatch only |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | you, for local dev | selects the OpenRouter backend when no sidecar is present |
| `POC_MODEL` | you | OpenRouter model id (default `qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507`); ignored on the sidecar path |
| `POC_CANNED` | you | `1` (or `--canned`) forces the fixed response, overriding both |
| `POC_HOST` / `POC_PORT` | you | the game server (default `127.0.0.1` / `21815`) |
| `POC_SLOT` / `POC_TOKEN` | you | the play seat and its configured token |
| `POC_PLAYBOOK` | the image | directory of `.wasm` modules to upload |
| `POC_RECALL_SECONDS` | you | how long to hold before the mid-match re-call (default 6) |

The platform also injects `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, and deliberately
fake `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` / `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`
placeholders. This harness ignores all of them — it sends no `Authorization`
header at all, because the sidecar strips whatever the client sends and
re-signs with the real pod identity. All six are reserved: the platform strips
them from an uploaded secret-env and re-applies its own.

### The model backends

Selected in this order, production first (`brain.py`, `build_brain`):

**1. The hosted LLM sidecar — the production path.** A deployed policy image
does **not** carry model credentials. The platform runs a per-pod proxy on
loopback that holds the real identity and bills the call to this pod's player
slot. It speaks **OpenAI-compatible chat completions, served by OpenRouter**.

- `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME` (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:9100`) is the
  signal that the hosted proxy is available. **The name is historical** — the
  sidecar began as a Bedrock proxy and kept the variable when OpenRouter
  routing became the serving path — so do not read it as "Bedrock only". Gate on
  it rather than `USE_BEDROCK`, which is also set for direct local AWS access
  with no sidecar in front of it.
- `POST {endpoint}/v1/chat/completions`, an ordinary OpenAI chat-completions
  body, `response_format: {"type": "json_object"}` supported.
- **No `Authorization` header.** The sidecar supplies the real credential.
- **Do not send `X-Coworld-Player-Slot`.** On a player pod the sidecar defaults
  attribution to that pod's own slot, and a value disagreeing with it is
  rejected outright (`_resolve_request_attribution`,
  `app_backend/.../job_runner/bedrock_sidecar.py:1387-1404`). Sending nothing is
  correct and safer. The header is stripped before the upstream call anyway.
- `BEDROCK_MODEL` carries the model id from `--bedrock-model` at upload. It must
  be read, never hardcoded. Whatever string arrives is resolved through the
  sidecar's legacy-id alias table to a canonical OpenRouter slug and then checked
  against the model allowlist (`resolve_model`,
  `app_backend/.../job_runner/llm_sidecar.py:260-268`), so a legacy Bedrock id
  *and* a canonical `vendor/model` slug both work. If the endpoint is set and
  this is not, the harness logs it and tries the default model instead.
- **A completions failure never kills the policy.** Every live backend is
  wrapped in `ResilientBrain`: the first failure of any kind — the sidecar's
  allowlist `403 model_not_allowed`, an unreachable proxy, unusable output —
  is logged once, no further model calls are attempted, and the seat keeps
  playing on canned decisions (each starter's own persona-scripted turns).
  A policy that cannot reach its LLM plays dumb; it does not exit 1 and
  forfeit the seat.
- Rate limited per player slot; a 429 carries `Retry-After` / `Retry-After-Ms`,
  honoured once. Every call is timeout-bounded, because a slow call times the
  episode out and scores as a loss.

To deploy: `coworld upload-policy ... --use-bedrock --bedrock-model <id>`.
Without `--use-bedrock` the pod gets no sidecar and this backend never engages.

**2. Direct OpenRouter — local development only.** Selected when
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set and no sidecar endpoint is present. Default model
`qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507` (open weights, ~$0.05 per million prompt
tokens).

Because the hosted proxy and OpenRouter speak the same protocol, **(1) and (2)
are the same class** — `OpenAiChatBrain`, differing only in URL and whether an
`Authorization` header is attached. That is most of why `brain.py` is small.

**3. Canned.** A fixed response, so the image is testable offline and in CI.
Forced by `--canned`, and the fallback when neither of the above is configured.

**Opt-in fallback: the legacy Bedrock `InvokeModel` path.** The sidecar still
accepts the Bedrock shapes, so `POC_LLM_PROTOCOL=bedrock` switches the hosted
call to `POST {endpoint}/model/{model}/invoke` with an Anthropic Messages body.
It is never auto-selected and is **not** load-bearing: James states OpenRouter
routing is the production truth. It exists only as an escape hatch if the
OpenAI-compatible route ever misbehaves for a particular model. Note it has no
`response_format`, so it forces JSON by prefilling the assistant turn with `{`.

#### How routing actually works, and the one gap worth flagging

Routing is a **global backend setting, not per-league**.
`devops/app-manifests/values.yaml` sets `coworldOpenRouterRouting.enabled: true`
with `episodePercent: 100` — a James-authorized ramp to 100% on
2026-08-29 01:08Z, with the whole ramp history in that file's comments.
Assignment is a deterministic per-episode hash (`assignmentSalt`) gated by that
percent, so at 100% every new episode routes to OpenRouter.

Confirmed against production on 2026-08-31 (`coworld leagues --json`, 125
leagues): `LeagueSettings`
(`app_backend/src/metta/app_backend/v2/league_settings_schema.py:158`) has **no
routing field at all**. The only per-league LLM knob is
`settings.llm.player_model_allowlist` (`:139-146`), which restricts models — it
does not switch providers. The one per-request override,
`llm_routing_override`, is team-only and requires `num_episodes=1`
(`v2/routes/experience_requests.py:845-851`), i.e. a canary knob, not a league
setting.

> **The gap:** the chart's own default is the opposite of production. 
> `devops/charts/observatory-backend/values.yaml:204-206` ships
> `enabled: false, episodePercent: 0` ("Keep disabled with zero percent until a
> separately reviewed rollout"), and the backend config default is likewise
> `COWORLD_OPENROUTER_ROUTING_ENABLED: bool = False`
> (`job_runner/config.py:189`). Production is correct only because the
> app-manifest overrides both. So the primary path here depends on a
> deployment-level override rather than a code default: any environment
> installed from the chart without that override serves 503
> `"OpenRouter is not configured"` on `/v1/chat/completions`
> (`bedrock_sidecar.py:1211-1213`) and only the Bedrock shapes work. Flagged,
> not resolved — that is a platform call, not this PoC's.

### What the model is asked, and how far it is trusted

Each backend gets the same system prompt — the two plays and their parameter
ranges, transcribed from the reference manifests — plus a short match summary,
and returns `{"chat": ..., "call": {"entries": [...]}}`. The summary names
people: the engine's PlayContext roster carries each seat's display name
(since 2026-09-02), so self, partner, the roster, and the last twelve heard
huddle lines are rendered as `name (seat N)`, and the rules tell the model to
address players by name in chat while calls keep `seat:<N>`
(`test_summary.py`). The mid-match summary
also carries **the ladder currently in force**, so the second call is a revision
rather than a fresh decision. Without that, a model handed the same map facts
twice simply repeats itself, which is exactly what the first live run did.

The model is never trusted. `build_call` in `poc_policy.py` drops unknown plays
and parameters, clamps numbers into their manifest ranges, coerces
integer-typed parameters to JSON integers, rewrites `partners` into sorted
unique `seat:N` references, enforces `MaxActiveOverlays`, and falls back to a
bare `edge_ride` entry if nothing survives. Whatever it produces still has to
pass the server's validator.

---

## Where the docs and schemas were not enough

The point of writing the harness in Python was to find out what a real policy
author hits. The headline is not that the protocol is undocumented — it is
documented thoroughly. `docs/designs/strategy-play-calling-shell-2026-08-29.md`
carries a complete normative packet table (§4.3, its lines 487-509), the
per-tick admission budgets, the id-floor rule, the canonical encoding rules,
and the parameter kinds. Almost everything below is a *findability* problem or
a gap between what the spec says and what the validator checks.

1. **There is no client-facing protocol reference.** The file named
   `docs/PROTOCOL.md` is Sprite v1 and never mentions a Season 2 packet. The
   normative table lives 490 lines into a 3,501-line design document that also
   carries lane assignments, budget tables, and implementation planning. An
   outside policy author opening the obviously-named document learns nothing,
   and the document that would tell them is not written for them. This is the
   single highest-leverage thing to fix.

2. **The join handshake is documented only in passing.** That a play seat
   connects to `/player?slot=N&token=T` with the token from
   `config["tokens"][slot]` appears in a recon note
   (`docs/recon/paintbot-s2-policy-shell-2026-08-29.md:631`) and in the
   paintball design's file inventory, but nowhere in the Season 2 material.
   In practice I read it out of `tools/run_first_light.sh`.

3. **Nothing warns that a play socket also carries the legacy Sprite stream.**
   The design doc explains the *inbound* leading-byte split (§4.3's Sprite
   row) but says nothing about the outbound direction. A client that treats
   every binary message it receives as a shell packet fails immediately; a
   conforming one must ignore unknown leading bytes. That rule is only visible
   by running against a real server.

4. **Exceeding a per-tick admission budget is silent.** The budgets are
   documented (1 upload, 2 calls per seat per tick). What is not documented is
   that going over them produces no status entry — the drop is a counter in
   `control_view.counters`. A client that uploads its whole playbook back to
   back loses everything after the first module and is told nothing.

5. **The status `kind` strings are not in the docs at all.** `module_accepted`,
   `module_ready`, `call_accepted`, `call_rejected`, `play_faulted`,
   `retune_refused` — the literal wire values a client switches on — appear
   zero times in the design document. They are in
   `status_entry.schema.json` and, much more usefully, in the eight goldens
   under `tests/fixtures/shell/status_*.golden.json`. Those goldens are
   excellent and answered every question I had; nothing links to them from
   anywhere a policy author would look.

6. **Most of the refusal vocabulary is undocumented.** `nameBound` is in the
   design doc; `playUnknown`, `unknownParam`, `unknownReference`,
   `duplicateEntryId`, `notSorted`, `range` are not. They are defined only by
   the `invalid(...)` call sites in `src/shell/call_validation.nim`. The
   messages themselves are genuinely good — `playUnknown:call.plays[0].play`
   told me exactly what was wrong — but you have to read the validator to know
   the vocabulary exists, and a client cannot branch on values it has never
   seen listed.

7. **`duo:<team>` needs a server-side *configured* duo, and the doc's own
   example does not survive that.** §4.3 says `duo:` references are valid in
   BR mode, and both the worked example (design doc line 2082) and
   `ladder_call.golden.json` use `duo:navy`. But
   `validateSeatOrDuoRef` also requires `ctx.duoSeats[team].configured`, so
   copying the documented example into a call can come back
   `unknownReference`. `seat:N` is the form that always works. The PoC's
   sanitizer rewrites `duo:` refs away for exactly this reason.

8. **`"set"` params sort by their canonical *encoded* form.** The doc says
   sets are "sorted and deduplicated"; only `validateSortedUnique` shows the
   comparison is on encoded strings, so `partners` sorts as
   `["seat:10", "seat:2"]` rather than numerically. That is the kind of detail
   that turns into a `notSorted` refusal on a call that looks obviously right.

9. **`"integer": true` params must be JSON integers, not integral floats.**
   The doc states the spec flag; `call_validation.nim` is where you learn the
   check is on the JSON *kind* (`jkInt`). In Python that means a value must
   never round-trip through `float`, and getting it wrong yields
   `range:...must be integral` — a message that reads like a bounds error.

10. **The schemas do not carry canonicality.** `ladder_call.schema.json` says
    nothing about key order or number grammar, and puts `MaxCallBytes` in a
    `$comment`. An author who validates against the schema alone produces
    bytes the server refuses. The canonical grammar is only in
    `src/shell/canonical.nim` (which is an excellent reference implementation)
    and in the design doc's Appendix P. Worth a `$comment` on the schema
    pointing at both.

11. **`ladder_call.golden.json` has no integral float.** It shows `0.8` and
    `0.4`, so the rule that an integral float keeps its `.0` — the single
    easiest canonical-encoding mistake to make — has no specimen. One more
    golden with a `1.0` in it would close that.

12. **Nothing tells you the server will not answer.** The largest cost in this
    exercise was not any of the above: it was discovering, by reading
    `src/ctf/server.nim` far enough to find that the consumers are never
    registered, that a correct client gets silence. The failure mode is a
    counter, not a status or a close, so from the client side it is
    indistinguishable from a bug in your own bytes.

### On the platform side, by contrast

The hosted-LLM path is documented *well* for the Bedrock shapes.
`packages/coworld/src/coworld/docs/BEDROCK.md` in metta is close to what a
client-facing protocol reference should look like: one rule in a callout at the
top, a table of every env var with what you do with it, working snippets for
three SDKs plus hand-rolled HTTP, and a troubleshooting table keyed by symptom.

The gap is that **it documents the Bedrock shapes, and production serves
OpenRouter through an OpenAI-compatible route the player docs never mention.**
Working only from `BEDROCK.md`, this PoC first shipped an `InvokeModel` client
and a README asserting that `/v1/chat/completions` was a 503 trap to avoid — a
conclusion drawn from the chart's unconfigured default rather than the
deployment. The primary production path is exactly the one the player-facing
documentation tells you not to use. Both routes work today, so nothing is
broken; but a policy author reading the docs will not find the live path, and an
author who finds the route by inspection has no documentation for it.

One smaller inconsistency: `PLAYER.md` says to use `InvokeModel` "not
`Converse`", while `BEDROCK.md` and the sidecar's own route table both list
`Converse` and `ConverseStream` as supported.

What was more than sufficient: `src/shell/packets.nim` reads as a
specification — the length equations and the four rejection kinds are
unambiguous, and the Python codec was a direct transcription with no guessing.
`src/shell/canonical.nim` is the same. And the golden fixtures under
`tests/fixtures/shell/` answer nearly every "what do the bytes actually look
like" question, once you know they are there.

## Recorded runs

### Live, against a real model (OpenRouter dev path)

`qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507`, two real completions, local play-seat server,
slot 0. The model picked the partner seat out of the `play_context` it was
given, and the mid-match turn revised the standing ladder rather than repeating
it — `edge_ride` `margin` 240 → 200 as the zone closes, `pact` left alone:

```
model backend: qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507 (OpenRouter model ... (dev path))

turn 1 -> {"call": {"entries": [
             {"entry_id": "ride", "params": {"margin": 240}, "play": "edge_ride"},
             {"entry_id": "ally", "params": {"onBetrayal": "disengage",
                "partners": ["seat:1"], "protect": true}, "play": "pact"}]},
           "chat": "Edge ride with my bro seat 1 - don't get greedy, we're
                    riding the zone together."}

turn 2 -> {"call": {"entries": [
             {"entry_id": "ride", "params": {"margin": 200}, "play": "edge_ride"},

The chat lines are worth noting on their own: the model emits em dashes and
curly apostrophes, and they survive the 0xA3 → 0xB2 round trip byte-exactly,
which exercises the UTF-8 measured-in-bytes cap on that packet.

### The hosted sidecar backend (primary path)

Exercised against a local stub implementing the sidecar's routes
(`GET /healthz/core-v1`, `POST /v1/chat/completions`, and the legacy
`POST /model/{id}/invoke`), forwarding upstream the way the real sidecar does:

```
model backend: sidecar-openai us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0
               (hosted sidecar at http://127.0.0.1:9141,
                OpenAI-compatible chat completions)

[stub] openai_chat model='us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0'
                -> 'anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5'
       client_auth=False  slot_header=None  json_mode=True

turn 1 -> edge_ride{margin:240}
          chat: "Edge ride or die, partner — you stay close, I'll handle the zone."
          opening call ACCEPTED: epoch=1 proposal_id=1 tick=7
turn 2 -> edge_ride{margin:240} + pact{partners:["seat:1"],protect:true,
                                       onBetrayal:"disengage"}
          chat: "Edge's tight, but we're rolling with cover—stay sharp, seat 1."
          mid-match re-call ACCEPTED: epoch=2 proposal_id=2 tick=20
real model calls: 2 | all PoC steps passed
```

Three contract details visible in one line of stub log: `client_auth=False`
(the harness sends no `Authorization`, the sidecar supplies it),
`slot_header=None` (attribution is left to the pod's own slot), and the legacy
model id resolving through the alias table to a canonical OpenRouter slug.

**This has not been run against a real hosted sidecar** — only against a stub
built to the contract read out of the sidecar's source. The remaining risk is a
code-versus-behaviour difference the stub reproduces faithfully by construction.

Backend selection, all seven branches:

```
sidecar                          -> sidecar-openai   {endpoint}/v1/chat/completions
sidecar + OPENROUTER_API_KEY     -> sidecar-openai   (hosted wins)
sidecar + POC_LLM_PROTOCOL=bedrock -> bedrock-invoke {endpoint}/model/{id}/invoke
sidecar, no BEDROCK_MODEL        -> BrainError, refuses loudly
OPENROUTER_API_KEY only          -> qwen/...         openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions
neither                          -> canned
--canned                         -> canned (overrides everything)
```

### Canned, offline

The same sequence with a fixed response, which is what CI runs:

```
0xB0 play_context: {"gun_range":497,"map":{"height":1713,"name":"br-gen-4242","width":3211},
                    "mode":"br","roster":[...32 rows...],"schema":"play_context",
                    "self":{"duo_partner":1,"seat":0,"team":"red"},"v":1,"view_interval":6}
0xB1 status: {"gen":"1","kind":"module_accepted","ordinal":"1","upload_id":"1"}
0xB1 status: {"gen":"1","kind":"module_ready","name":"edge_ride","ordinal":"2",
              "sha256":"399962bc1aa1e2c5b9e218e72d61b5154b502244e473c55a50a1710aa49d9c38",
              "upload_id":"1"}
0xB1 status: {"gen":"1","kind":"module_ready","name":"pact","ordinal":"4",
              "sha256":"cf092e1af573da829bc9805fcdfeaef662f40fa5bd35e5b45b6793ab1addf3ec",
              "upload_id":"2"}
0xB1 status: {"epoch":"1","gen":"1","kind":"call_accepted","ordinal":"1",
              "proposal_id":"1","tick":7}
0xB1 status: {"epoch":"2","gen":"1","kind":"call_accepted","ordinal":"2",
              "proposal_id":"2","tick":20}
```

And the negative probe, confirming the production validator is doing the work:

```
sending: {"plays":[{"entry_id":"bad","params":{"margin":9999},"play":"edge_ride"}]}
STATUS   {"gen":"1","kind":"call_rejected","ordinal":"1","proposal_id":"1",
          "reason":"playUnknown:call.plays[0].play"}
```

(The seat in that probe never uploaded `edge_ride`, so the play name is
unbound — the validator refuses the name before it ever reaches the out-of-range
`margin`.)

The same canned run out of the container, against the same server on slot 5,
also reaches `call_accepted` at epoch 2 with the image-built playbook — whose
`pact` hash (`7a4d2772…`) differs from a host build's, since the wasm carries
build-path detail. `edge_ride` happens to match (`399962bc…`).
